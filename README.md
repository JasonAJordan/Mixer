# Cocktail Mixer Search
## Here is an ios app which let the user search for cocktails and how to make them.

My app is a cocktail mixing app. Users can either search for a cocktail by name or select a random one. 
My audience are people who want to drink but do not know how to create cocktails. 

This app interagates an API for all the cocktails.
Documentation URL for API: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
